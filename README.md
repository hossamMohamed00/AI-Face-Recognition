# Face Recognition using Clustering Techniques (K-means algorithm)

## Description
A facial recognition system is a technology capable of identifying or verifying a person from a digital image or a video frame from a video source.
There are multiple methods in which facial recognition systems work, but in general, they work by comparing selected facial features from given image with faces within a database.
It is also described as a Biometric Artificial Intelligence based application that can uniquely identify a person byanalysing patterns based on the person's facial textures and shape.
